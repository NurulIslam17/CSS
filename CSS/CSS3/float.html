			<p>	People in many parts of the [western] world
				still think that Bangladesh is in India and whenever I hear that, I get frustrated and saddened. Bangladesh is considered to be a third world country and the etymology of the term 'third world' is quite interesting. It was coined by a French economist and demographer named Alfred Sauvy,who considered these developing countries in South Asia, Latin America and Africa to be like the Third Estate in France.
