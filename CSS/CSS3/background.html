		<h1 class="h1"> Bangladesh </h1>
		<p>People in many parts of the [western] world still think that Bangladesh is in India and whenever I hear that, I get frustrated and saddened. Bangladesh is considered to be a third world country and the etymology of the term 'third world' is quite interesting. It was coined by a French economist and demographer named Alfred Sauvy,who considered these developing countries in South Asia, Latin America and Africa to be like the Third Estate in France.

		<p>Bangladesh is one of the poorest and densely populated countries in the world. It is located in South Asia and is bordered by India from three sides, Burma from the southeast corner and the Bay of Bengal from the south. As we studied in our world politics class, political realism which “emphasizes the role of the nation-state and makes a broad assumption that all nation-states are motivated by national interests, or, at best, national interests disguised as moral concerns” comes into play. In 1952, the Language Movement took place, and the purpose was to make Bengali one of the official languages in East Pakistan. They succeeded and in 2000, UNESCO declared 21 February Inernational Mother Language Day to recognize the objective of the Language Movement and promote the ethno-linguistic rights of all citizens. Next, the idea of political realism is highlighted in the 1971 Liberation War in which was fought to gain independence and establish Bangladesh as a sovereign nation.
